This package contains codes and data for the proposed denoising method in the paper "Adaptive Image Denoising by Targeted Databases", accepted by Trans. Image Process.

To have an overall evaluation of the denoising performance, please run the demo file: "demo.m". For comparison purposes, we also provide the codes for some state-of-the-art denoising methods including BM3D, BM3D-PCA, LPG-PCA, and NLM. All these methods are re-implemented and modified by us such that patch search is performed over the targeted external databases. To compare with internal BM3D denoising, one can download the original code provided by the BM3D authors: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/. The text database is prepared by us from randomly selected documents. The face database is obtained fromhe FEI face dataset: http://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html.

Please note that the results in the paper are generated by running the corresponding codes a couple of times to reduce the bias due to a particular noise realization.

For more information on the problem we are solving, please see:
